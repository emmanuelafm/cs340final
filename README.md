**How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
**
With any program, I make sure it follows industry standards by making it concise and efficient. I also add as many comments as possible to ensure readability and adaptability. If future developers understand how the code works, they can in turn adjust it so it still properly works and evolves.

**How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

As a computer scientist, I want to look at the big picture first. What is the end goal of my program or project, and what are the issues holding me back from achieving that? This project required the learning of Jupyter Notebook, Linux systems and MongoDB, so the learning aspect took over a majority of my work rather than following a formulaic process.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists develop and maintain software applications. If Grazioso Salvare planned on continuing this program for company-wide use, they would need a software engineer to maintain the application/website, which is where mine or another developer's work would be necessary.
